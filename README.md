## Product Background
The project entails developing a Jewelry Store Management Software to efficiently manage sales, promotions, and buyback transactions across multiple counters within a jewelry retail business. The software enables seamless creation of sales orders and printing of invoices, supports barcode scanning or manual input for product identification, and generates warranty certificates for jewelry items. It also facilitates the management of promotional campaigns and customer-specific discounts, with authorization required for discount application. Moreover, it handles buyback transactions with special pricing policies, assists in retrieving past sales invoices, and displays real-time gold prices in-store. Additionally, the software includes features for implementing a customer loyalty program, managing employee allocation and performance, maintaining product catalogs, pricing management, and providing analytics through a comprehensive dashboard, thereby aiming to streamline operations and optimize business performance for jewelry retailers.
